\title{Compute standardized alpha level based on unstandardized alpha level and the number of observations N.}
\usage{
alpha_standardized(alpha, N, standardize_N = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{The unstandardized alpha level (e.g., 0.05), independent of the sample size.}

\item{N}{The number of observations (e.g., the sample size) in the dataset}

\item{standardize_N}{The number of observations (e.g., the sample size) you want to use to standardize the alpha level for. Defaults to 100 (base on Good, 1982).}
}
\description{
Compute standardized alpha level based on unstandardized alpha level and the number of observations N.

\examples{
## Check it yields .05 for N = 100:
alpha_standardized(alpha = 0.05, N = 100)
## Check it yields .05 for N = 200:
alpha_standardized(alpha = 0.07071068, N = 200)
## Which alpha should we use with N = 200?
alpha_standardized(alpha = 0.05, N = 200)
## You can change the standardization N, repeating the example above:
alpha_standardized(alpha = 0.05, N = 100, standardize_N = 200)
}
